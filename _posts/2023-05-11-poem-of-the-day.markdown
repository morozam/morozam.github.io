polyvinyl chloride stretched out,
such smooth, silky surface
I long for.

I long to dig my fingernails
into old wooden poles and
peel the ancient layers of primer and sweat.

the dust that falls from
long black curtains,
crunchy sound of rosin,
stickiness of hairspray.

There is no return to the turning underworld.
